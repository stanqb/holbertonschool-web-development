# HTML Advanced

## Description

This project focuses on creating a webpage from scratch using only HTML semantic structure. The goal is to implement a complete HTML page based on a Figma designer file, without any CSS styling or external libraries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is HTML
- How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
- What is a markup language
- What is the DOM
- What is an element/tag
- What is an attribute
- The purpose of each HTML tag

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- No external libraries allowed (NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Only HTML/CSS/JavaScript are permitted
- Code must be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator

## Project Structure

The webpage consists of the following sections:

1. **Header** - Contains navigation links and logo
2. **Banner** - Main hero section with headings, text, and call-to-action
3. **Quote** - Testimonial section with blockquote
4. **Videos** - List of video content with ratings
5. **Membership** - Membership options section
6. **FAQ** - Frequently asked questions
7. **Footer** - Site footer with links and information

## Tasks Overview

- **Task 0**: Create README and project setup
- **Task 1**: Implement HTML header structure
- **Task 2**: Build banner section inside main
- **Task 3**: Add quote/testimonial section
- **Task 4**: Create videos list section
- **Task 5**: Implement membership section

## Design Reference

The design is available on Figma. Key design notes:
- Missing fonts can be found: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- Float values can be rounded as needed
- Focus on semantic HTML structure only (no styling in this phase)

## Validation

All HTML code must pass W3C validation to ensure compliance with web standards.
